# Portfolio-
This is my first portfolio, built using HTML and CSS without JavaScript. It took more than 15 days of practice, and I put my full effort into it. As a beginner, I used ChatGPT for guidance when I was confused about design decisions, but the ideas and implementation were my own. I imagined the layout, planned it, and wrote all the code myself.
